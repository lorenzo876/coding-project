<h2> The Bird </h2>
<hr>
<p>The bird of Hermes is my name I have devoured                                              my wings to make me tame for I am the one to blame                                          for bringing forth destruction's flame</p>
<p>The bird of Hermes is my name bringing chaos is                                          my came From Mt Olympus I hail and all of the god's                                      grace shall fail Nothing will remain the same for all                                        has been consumed by my flame Everything into ashes oh                                      so frail and a world covered by my bloody veil</p>
<p>Hermes is my name and my bird has become tamed No                                     longer from the heavens it shall hail and forevermore                                       the rivers of blood it shall sail</p>
<p>The bird of Hermes is my name My message has been                                   delivered now that I am tamed From the heavens chaos                                       and destruction shall hail and forevermore this world                                        has become my bloody hell</p>
